import { render, screen, fireEvent, waitFor } from '@testing-library/react';
import userEvent from '@testing-library/user-event';
import { EvidenceUpload } from './EvidenceUpload';

describe('EvidenceUpload Component', () => {
  it('should upload evidence file successfully', async () => {
    const mockOnUpload = jest.fn();
    render(<EvidenceUpload onUpload={mockOnUpload} />);
    
    const file = new File(['evidence'], 'evidence.log', { type: 'text/plain' });
    const input = screen.getByLabelText(/upload file/i);
    
    await userEvent.upload(input, file);
    
    await waitFor(() => {
      expect(mockOnUpload).toHaveBeenCalledWith(expect.objectContaining({
        name: 'evidence.log',
        size: file.size
      }));
    });
  });
  
  it('should display error for invalid file type', async () => {
    render(<EvidenceUpload allowedTypes={['pdf', 'txt']} />);
    
    const file = new File(['data'], 'image.png', { type: 'image/png' });
    const input = screen.getByLabelText(/upload file/i);
    
    await userEvent.upload(input, file);
    
    expect(screen.getByText(/invalid file type/i)).toBeInTheDocument();
  });
});
```

### 2.3 CI/CD Platform

**GitHub Actions**
- **Justification:** 
  - Native integration with GitHub repositories
  - Free for public repositories, cost-effective for private
  - Extensive marketplace of pre-built actions
  - Parallel job execution for faster builds
  - Easy configuration with YAML
  - Built-in secrets management
  - Docker container support

## 3. Testing Procedure

### 3.1 Development Workflow

```
Feature Branch → Development → Main
     ↓              ↓            ↓
  Local Tests   All Tests    All Tests
                + Lint       + Deploy
                + Coverage   
```

**Branch Strategy:**

1. **Feature Branches** (`feature/*`, `bugfix/*`)
   - Developers write tests alongside feature implementation
   - All unit tests must pass locally before PR
   - Minimum 70% code coverage for new code

2. **Development Branch** (`develop`)
   - Unit tests and integration tests run automatically on push
   - Linting and code quality checks enforced
   - Test coverage reports generated
   - Docker builds verified
   - Security scans (Trivy, Gosec)
   - Performance and reliability tests run on scheduled basis
   - Manual QA verification before merging to main

3. **Main Branch** (`main`)
   - Production-ready code only
   - All automated tests must pass
   - Deployment to on-site server
   - Post-deployment smoke tests

### 3.2 Test-Driven Development (TDD)

For critical security and chain-of-custody features, we follow TDD:

1. Write failing test that defines expected behavior
2. Implement minimum code to pass the test
3. Refactor while keeping tests green
4. Add additional test cases for edge cases

**Critical Features Requiring TDD:**
- Evidence upload and storage
- Chain-of-custody logging
- Access control and permissions
- Encryption/decryption operations
- Audit trail generation

### 3.3 Code Review Requirements

Pull requests must meet the following criteria:

- ✅ All automated tests pass
- ✅ Code coverage ≥ 75% overall
- ✅ New features have corresponding tests
- ✅ Integration tests for API changes
- ✅ No critical security vulnerabilities
- ✅ Linting passes with zero errors
- ✅ At least one peer review approval

---

## 4. Test Categories & Requirements

### 4.1 Unit Tests

**Purpose:** Test individual functions and methods in isolation

**Requirements:**
- Must mock all external dependencies (database, IPFS, external APIs)
- Should execute in < 100ms per test
- Coverage target: ≥ 80% for business logic

**Example Structure:**
```go
// services/evidence/metadata/service_test.go
func TestUploadEvidence_Success(t *testing.T) {
    // Arrange
    mockRepo := new(MockRepository)
    mockIPFS := new(MockIPFSClient)
    svc := NewService(mockRepo, mockIPFS)
    
    // Act
    err := svc.UploadEvidence(validRequest)
    
    // Assert
    require.NoError(t, err)
    mockRepo.AssertExpectations(t)
}
```

### 4.2 Integration Tests

**Purpose:** Test interaction between components (e.g., API → Service → Database)

**Requirements:**
- Use test database with migrations
- Clean database state between tests
- Test complete request/response cycles
- Test HTTP endpoints with various inputs
- Test authentication and authorization
- Test request validation and error responses
- Coverage target: ≥ 70% for integration paths

**Example Structure:**
```go
// integration_test/evidence_test.go
func TestEvidenceUploadFlow(t *testing.T) {
    // Setup test database and router
    testDB := setupTestDB(t)
    defer cleanupTestDB(testDB)
    
    router := setupRouter(testDB)
    server := httptest.NewServer(router)
    defer server.Close()
    
    // Test full upload flow including HTTP request
    w := httptest.NewRecorder()
    req := httptest.NewRequest("POST", "/api/v1/evidence", body)
    req.Header.Set("Authorization", "Bearer "+token)
    
    router.ServeHTTP(w, req)
    require.Equal(t, http.StatusCreated, w.Code)
}
```

### 4.3 Security Tests

**Purpose:** Verify security controls and prevent vulnerabilities

**Requirements:**
- Test SQL injection prevention
- Test XSS prevention
- Test CSRF protection
- Test authentication bypass attempts
- Test authorization boundaries
- Test input validation and sanitization
- Run automated security scans (Trivy, Gosec)

**Example Structure:**
```go
func TestSQLInjectionPrevention(t *testing.T) {
    maliciousInput := "1' OR '1'='1"
    
    result, err := repo.FindCaseByID(maliciousInput)
    
    require.Error(t, err)
    require.Nil(t, result)
}
```

### 4.4 Performance Tests

**Purpose:** Ensure system meets performance requirements under normal load

**Requirements:**
- Benchmark critical operations
- Test response times under load
- Verify database query performance
- Test file upload/download speeds
- Performance targets must be met

**Example Structure:**
```go
func BenchmarkEvidenceUpload(b *testing.B) {
    setup := setupBenchmark(b)
    defer setup.Cleanup()
    
    b.ResetTimer()
    for i := 0; i < b.N; i++ {
        _ = setup.Service.UploadEvidence(testRequest)
    }
}

func TestAPIResponseTime(t *testing.T) {
    start := time.Now()
    
    resp := makeRequest("/api/v1/cases")
    
    duration := time.Since(start)
    require.Less(t, duration, 500*time.Millisecond)
    require.Equal(t, http.StatusOK, resp.StatusCode)
}
```

### 4.5 Reliability Tests

**Purpose:** Ensure system handles high load and concurrent operations

**Requirements:**
- Simulate concurrent users (10-100)
- Test endpoint performance under stress
- Error rate must be < 5% under normal load
- Response time must be < 2s at 95th percentile
- Test system recovery from failures

**Example Structure:**
```go
func TestStressEndpoints(t *testing.T) {
    concurrentUsers := 50
    totalRequests := 1000
    
    result := runStressTest(t, endpoint, concurrentUsers, totalRequests)
    
    require.Less(t, result.ErrorRate, 5.0, "Error rate too high")
    require.Less(t, result.P95Latency, 2*time.Second)
}
```

### 4.6 Chain-of-Custody Tests

**Purpose:** Verify evidence integrity and audit trail compliance

**Requirements:**
- Verify all evidence actions are logged
- Test tamper-proof logging mechanisms
- Verify checksums and file integrity
- Test evidence retrieval maintains chain-of-custody
- Verify timestamp accuracy and immutability
- 100% coverage required for critical paths

**Example Structure:**
```go
func TestEvidenceChainOfCustody(t *testing.T) {
    // Upload evidence
    evidenceID := uploadTestEvidence(t)
    
    // Verify log entry created
    logs := getEvidenceLogs(t, evidenceID)
    require.NotEmpty(t, logs)
    require.Equal(t, "UPLOAD", logs[0].Action)
    
    // Verify checksum integrity
    originalChecksum := logs[0].Checksum
    currentChecksum := calculateChecksum(t, evidenceID)
    require.Equal(t, originalChecksum, currentChecksum)
}
```
